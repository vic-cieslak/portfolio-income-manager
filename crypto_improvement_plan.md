# Cryptocurrency Management Improvement Plan

## Issue Identified

We've encountered a TypeError in the cryptocurrency management part of the project:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'
```

This error occurs in the `current_value` property of the `Cryptocurrency` model when trying to multiply `quantity` (a Decimal) with `current_price` (a float). This type mismatch needs to be resolved.

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Fix the Type Error in the Model

Update the `current_value` property in the `Cryptocurrency` model to ensure proper type conversion:

```python
@property
def current_value(self):
    if self.current_price:
        from decimal import Decimal
        # Convert current_price to Decimal before multiplication
        return self.quantity * Decimal(str(self.current_price))
    return 0
```

### 2. Ensure Consistent Type Handling in CoinGeckoService

Update the `CoinGeckoService` class to ensure that prices retrieved from the API are properly converted to Decimal before being stored in the model:

```python
# In get_coin_data method
"current_price": Decimal(str(price_data[coin_id]["pln"])) if coin_id in price_data else Decimal('0')

# In update_crypto_prices method
crypto.current_price = Decimal(str(data[crypto.coin_id]["pln"]))
```

### 3. Additional Improvements to the Cryptocurrency Management

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Add more robust error handling for API requests
   - Implement rate limiting awareness for CoinGecko API
   - Add fallback mechanisms when API is unavailable

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add loading indicators during API calls
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Add price change indicators (up/down arrows with percentage)

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Historical price tracking
   - Portfolio performance metrics
   - Price alerts
   - Export functionality for tax reporting

## Implementation Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the model fix
2. Update the CoinGeckoService to ensure proper type conversion
3. Test the cryptocurrency list view to ensure the error is resolved
4. Implement the additional improvements in order of priority

## Technical Considerations

- Use Django's `decimal.Decimal` for all monetary values to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Consider implementing a caching layer for CoinGecko API responses to reduce API calls
- Add proper logging for API interactions to help with debugging
- Consider implementing a background task for price updates to improve performance

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional cryptocurrency APIs for redundancy
- Real-time price updates using WebSockets
- Advanced portfolio analytics
- Multi-currency support
